/// Overall store for all the referrals sent by user and wheter user has redeemed a referral code.
/// For privacy reasones the backend has no information about the user or client app.
/// So, there is no way to ask the backend for all the referrals created by this app/user without providing the referral code.
/// Instead, we  store the generated referrals locally in user defaults and use them to check with the backend.
/// Use this store to also tell the user the status of their shared invites.
/// Calling `checkReferrals()` synchonizes the local referrals with the backend.
/// `usedReferralsCount` can be used to update your UI so user can see the status of their invites.
/// You can use referrals to be used multiple times e.g if you want the user to share on social media.
/// If you want ther user to send invites using a single-use referral then you can use this store to track which
/// code was used but you need to create your own logic to create a new referral when user wants to send an invite.
/// This sample creates only one referral that can be used by many invited users.
/// We recommend to use multi-use referrals for simplicity and the benefit of sharing it on social media.
/// Redeeming a code:
/// Any user who redeems a referral code can do so only once.
/// Use `saveHasRedeemedCode(_ code: state:)` to mark that the user has redeemed a code and
/// check next time they want to redeem a code that they haven't already via `hasRedeemedBefore`
